    <h2>ðŸ§  About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I value fairness, accountability, and community protectionâ€”and I bring that energy into every incident response, system audit, and security strategy I touch. Whether Iâ€™m documenting results for future adaptation or calmly navigating high-pressure threats, I operate with clarity, purpose, and outside-the-box thinking. Iâ€™m not just ahead of the curveâ€”I bend it. Welcome to the Cyberslimm era.

      My mission is to build a legacy through cybersecurityâ€”creating opportunities first for posterity, and second, serving as an example of whatâ€™s possible when drive, creativity, and resilience come together. I donâ€™t just study threatsâ€”I simulate the impossible.
